# Etch-a-Sketch project
This <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch" target="_blank">project</a> is a browser-based sketchpad that utilizes DOM manipulation. Users can interact with the grid to change colors, and they can also customize the grid size by entering a desired number of squares per side. The project showcases my skills in JavaScript, Flexbox, and event handling.

## Features
- Dynamic grid creation using JavaScript
- Hover effect to change square colors
- User input for customizable grid size
- Responsive design using Flexbox
